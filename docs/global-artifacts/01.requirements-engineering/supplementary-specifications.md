# Supplementary Specification (FURPS+)

## Functionality

_Specifies functionalities that:_

- _are common across several US/UC;_
- _are not related to US/UC, namely: Audit, Reporting and Security._

## Usability 

- "(...) use Javadoc to generate useful documentation for Java code."
- "(...) adopt recognized coding conventions
  and standards (...)"
- "All the images/figures produced during the software development process should be recorded in
  SVG format."


## Reliability
- Refers to the integrity, compliance and interoperability of the software. The requirements to be considered are: frequency and severity of failure, possibility of recovery, possibility of prediction, accuracy, average time between failures.
- When the application fails the algoritm keep the date safe
- "The application should use object serialization to ensure date persistence between two runs of the application"


## Performance
_Evaluates the performance requirements of the software, namely: response time, start-up time, recovery time, memory consumption, CPU usage, load capacity and application availability._
- The program should be able to support many users


## Supportability

- "The development team must implement unit tests for all methods, except for methods that
  implement Input/Output operations."_Specifies or constraints the system design process. Examples may include: programming languages, software process, mandatory standards/patterns, use of development tools, class library, etc._

- "The unit tests should be implemented using the JUnit 5 framework."
- "The JaCoCo plugin should be used to generate the coverage report."
- All images should be in SVG format

### Implementation Constraints


- "During the system development, the team must: (i) adopt best practices for identifying
  requirements, and for OO software analysis and design; (ii) adopt recognized coding conventions
  and standards (e.g., CamelCase); (iii) use Javadoc to generate useful documentation for Java code. "
- "The application must be developed in Java language using the IntelliJ IDE or NetBeans."
- "The unit tests should be implemented using the JUnit 5
  framework"



### Interface Constraints

### Physical Constraints

- "The application should use object serialization to ensure date persistence between two runs of the
application."
