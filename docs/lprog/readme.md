# LPROG grammars, listeners, and visitors explained

This document aims to briefly explain the grammars created and used by us in the LAPR4 integrative project. We will also present our reasons and thoughts to explain the use of Listeners or Visitors in different functionalities.

## Chronological Timeline of the Grammars

1. Question Import Grammars: 
The first grammars used by our group were these. These grammars were designed to validate .csv, .json, and .xml files. We defined 6 grammars in total, 3 for interviews and 3 for requirements.

2. Template Export Grammars: 
Next, we have these grammars. The purpose of these grammars is to validate the creation of templates according to the defined structures for both interviews and requirements. This functionality includes 2 grammars, 1 for interviews and 1 for requirements.

3. Answer Validation Grammars: 
Following that, we have these grammars. The objective of these grammars is to validate if the files maintain the structure and, for interviews, if the answers follow the requirements of each question type (e.g., for a true or false question, only true or false options should be allowed). Similar to the previous functionality, there is one grammar for each plugin type.

4. Interview/Requirements Evaluation Validation Grammars: 
Lastly, we have these grammars. These grammars solely aim to validate the structure of an evaluated file, including the results and possible justifications, in addition to the rest of the content. Once again, we used 2 grammars, 1 for interviews and 1 for requirements.

## Question Import Grammars

### Objective and Usage of these Grammars:

- These grammars were created with the purpose of verifying if .csv, .json, or .xml files follow the correct structure defined between the team and the client.

- In the context of the Integrative Project, these grammars were important for importing questions into the plugins and dynamically loading them whenever necessary.

- For the import part, we utilized the Listeners of each grammar. After some research, we concluded that Listeners are very useful for data import and export.

- Therefore, we traversed the entire Parse Tree and obtained the necessary information through the Listeners to import the questions into the system.

- These grammars were designed for the User Stories: [US-1008](../sprintb/us_1008/readme.md), [US-1009](../sprintb/us_1009/readme.md) (Requirements), and [US-1011](../sprintb/us_1011/readme.md) (Interviews).

## Template Export Grammars

### Objective and Usage of these Grammars:

- These grammars were created with the purpose of validating whether interview or requirement files follow the defined structure.

- In the context of the Integrative Project, these grammars were used to validate that the templates generated by the program were being generated correctly and following the client's requirements.

- For these functionalities, neither Listeners nor Visitors were used, and we simply traversed the Parse Trees to check for syntax errors.

- These grammars were designed for the User Stories: [US-1012](../sprintb/us_1012/readme.md) (Interviews) and [US-2003](../sprintb/us_2003/readme.md) (Requirements).

## Answer Validation Grammars

### Objective and Usage of these Grammars:

- These grammars were created with the purpose of validating the answers contained in the files filled out by the candidates.

- In the context of the Integrative Project, these grammars were used to validate the expected input type and the received input type, as well as to verify if the file structure was correct before loading it into the system.

- For these functionalities, Visitors were used to verify if the email in the file being loaded into the system and associated with a candidate matches the candidate's email.

- Visitors were also used to evaluate the candidates' answers by traversing the Parse Tree and collecting the answers, which will be used to calculate or determine a final result.

- These grammars were designed for the User Stories: [US-1017](../sprintc/us_1017/readme.md) (Interviews), [US-2004](../sprintc/us_2004/readme.md) (Requirements), [US-1018](../sprintc/us_1018/readme.md) (Interviews), and [US-1015](../sprintc/us_1015/readme.md) (Requirements).

## Interview/Requirements Evaluation Validation Grammars

### Objective and Usage of these Grammars:

- These grammars were created with the purpose of validating the files evaluated with grades and final results.

- In the context of the Integrative Project, these grammars were applied to ensure that the files generated after the automatic evaluation and analysis performed by the system are being created without syntax errors.

- For these functionalities, neither Listeners nor Visitors were used, and we simply traversed the Parse Trees to check for syntax errors.

- These grammars were designed for the User Stories: [US-1018](../sprintc/us_1018/readme.md) (Interviews) and [US-1015](../sprintc/us_1015/readme.md) (Requirements).

### Utilization of Listeners and Visitors

_N/A_

## Overview

In summary, several grammars were defined for the Integrative Project of LAPR4 and for the LPROG subject. These grammars were used to analyze the structure of the files and validate questions and answers. As a group, we decided to use Listeners for import functionalities and Visitors for answer evaluation and email validation functionalities in the files. We believe that the use of these tools was essential for the success of the project as they allowed us to develop different functionalities more efficiently and in an organized manner.

### Positive and Not so Positive Aspects

- Positive Aspects:
    1. The wide variety of grammars
    2. Usage of both Listeners and Visitors

- Not so Positive Aspects:
    1. The organization of rules across different grammars could be improved for better clarity and maintainability.
