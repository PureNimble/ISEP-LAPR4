# US 2002 - Register an application of a candidate for a job opening and import all files received

## 1. Context

- `Description:`  As Operator, I want to register an application of a candidate for a job opening and import all files received.

- `Sprint:` This US makes part of the intermediary stage of development of the integrative project of this semester, Sprint B.

- `Objectives:` The team must make sure that the system is able to import the data
from the file that was processed by the Application File Bot in Req 2001.
The files should be kept in the shared folder, but the Backoffice application needs
to know the references to the file locations.
