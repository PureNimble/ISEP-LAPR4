**Introduction**

The Personal Finance Tracker is a web application that allows users to track their income and expenses. The goal of this project was to create an easy-to-use tool that would help individuals better manage their finances. This report provides an overview of the project, including the technical details of the implementation and the results achieved.

**Technical Details**

The Personal Finance Tracker was developed using the following technologies:

* React for the front-end user interface
* Node.js for the back-end server
* MongoDB for the database

The application allows users to create an account, add income and expenses, and view their financial data in various formats. The front-end was built using React, with a focus on creating a user-friendly interface that was easy to navigate. The back-end server was implemented using Node.js, with a RESTful API for communicating with the front-end. The database was implemented using MongoDB, with a schema designed to efficiently store financial data.

The Personal Finance Tracker was successfully implemented and tested. The application allows users to easily add and track their financial data, with a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate. The application also provides various visualizations of the financial data, including charts and graphs, to help users better understand their financial situation.

During testing, the application performed well, with fast response times and no major bugs or issues. The team received positive feedback from users, who appreciated the ease of use and functionality of the application.
