/**
 * A Client User.
 * This class represents client users. It follows a DDD approach where User
 * is the root entity of the Base User Aggregate and all of its properties
 * are instances of value objects. A Client User references a System User
 * This approach may seem a little more complex than just having String or
 * native type attributes but provides for real semantic of the domain and
 * follows the Single Responsibility Pattern
