# Project Jobs4U

## 1. Description of the Project

As part of the [LEI](https://www.isep.ipp.pt/Course/Course/26) degree's integrative project at [ISEP](https://www.isep.ipp.pt) for the 2023/2024 academic year, we are embarking on a project to develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for Jobs4U aimed at automating their talent acquisition process. Our objective is to enhance the efficiency of how Jobs4U connects companies with top candidates. Within the next 3 months, we will collaborate to design, code, and deploy a system that optimizes the recruitment workflow, from identifying potential candidates to compiling a prioritized list of candidates for job offers. This repository serves as our central workspace, containing initial source code, project management tools, and comprehensive documentation to support us through the software development lifecycle.
